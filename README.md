This repository hosts the code for the paper

Ziyu Wang, Chris Holmes, *On Uncertainty Quantification for Near-Bayes Optimal Algorithms*

For the moment we are providing the code for the classification experiments. See
`classification/README.md` for instructions to reproduce the results in the paper. If you are
interested in any other experiment (and can bear with less clean code), feel free to contact me.
